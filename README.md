## A Smarter Way to Work with Multiple Git Repositories

Managing multiple Git repositories shouldn’t mean juggling terminals, IDE tabs, and half-remembered commands. This application gives you a unified, real-time control center for all your local Git repositories—so you can focus on writing code, not managing tooling.

Designed for developers who work across many projects, services, or teams, the app lets you add local repositories directly from your file system and operate on them with speed and confidence.

### What You Can Do

* **Stage and unstage files** with full visibility into changes.
* **Commit changes** quickly with clear diffs and status feedback.
* **Push to remotes** without leaving the app.
* **Checkout branches** and move between contexts effortlessly.
* **Create Pull Requests** directly from your local workflow.
* **Track real-time repository status** across all repos at once.
* **Manage multiple repositories simultaneously**, not one at a time.

### Why Engineers Love It

* **Single source of truth** – See the state of all your repositories in one place.
* **Real-time feedback** – Instantly know what’s clean, dirty, ahead, or behind.
* **No context switching** – Fewer terminals, fewer IDE hops, less cognitive load.
* **Works with your existing repos** – No cloning or restructuring required.
* **Built for scale** – Ideal for monorepos, microservices, and multi-project setups.

### Who It’s For

* Engineers working with **microservices or multi-repo architectures**.
* Developers juggling **multiple clients, teams, or side projects**.
* Power users who want **Git control without ceremony**.
* Anyone tired of manually checking repo status one by one.

If Git is central to your workflow—and you’re managing more than one repository—this tool turns chaos into clarity. Download it, connect your repositories, and take control of your Git workflow.
